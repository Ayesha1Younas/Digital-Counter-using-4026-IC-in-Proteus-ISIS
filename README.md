Circuit of Digital Counter using 4026 IC 
Its a really amazing project that we all use in our daily life many times. In this project, we designed a digital counter that can be controlled using the button present in it. It seems to a difficult circuit but all the work is done by a simple Integrated Circuit. For other interesting projects click at www.theengineeringprojects.com
